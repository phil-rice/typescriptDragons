# Dragons kata in typescript

All Dragons, when created, have:

* Health, starting at 1000
* May be Alive or Dead, starting Alive
* Dragons can Deal Damage to Dragons.
* The damage they take is subtracted from Health
* When damage received exceeds current Health, Health becomes 0 and the dragon dies

For extra points add Logging, and a Metric that counts the number of times a character is damaged.

# Step 1

# Step 2

Let's display the dragon in a component, with a button and damage the dragon when the button is pressed
